# Computer-Vision-egg-grading-system

## Description
Main goal of Computer Vision is to let the system able to see things. Thus, in this research going to develop a vision-based classification system that should be able to classify different grades of eggs. This research can help to grade the eggs without manual grade classification by using image processing techniques.

The objective of this research is to gain experience in applying image processing techniques to solve some bacis business problem.
